Time to practice on your work or a publication of your choice!
</p>


Steps:

1. Read the publication you have chosen.
2. Locate/highlight the areas of interest according to the DOME sections. (how many are covered? which are missing?)
3. Fill in this (*some kind of ready table template to be given*) with the information.
4. Discuss your results with the rest of the group. (do you see any common trends?)
5. Grab a beverage ‚òï or a snack üßÅ to celebrate!
