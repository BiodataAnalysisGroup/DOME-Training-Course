## Introduction

With the steep decline in the cost of many high-throughput technologies, large amounts of biological data are being generated and made accessible to researchers. 
Machine learning (ML) has come into the spotlight as a very useful approach for understanding cellular, genomic, proteomic, post-translational, metabolic and drug discovery data, with the potential to result in ground-breaking medical applications. 
This is clearly reflected in the corresponding growth of ML publications, reporting a wide range of modeling techniques in biology. 
While ideally ML methods should be validated experimentally, this happens only in a fraction of the publications. 
We believe that the time is right for the ML community to develop standards for reporting ML-based analyses to enable critical assessment and improve reproducibility.[@DOME]
